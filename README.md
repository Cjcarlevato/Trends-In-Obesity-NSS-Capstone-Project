# Trends-In-Obesity-NSS-Capstone-Project

## Central Project Objectives: <br>
### 1. Visualization of obesity rates overtime, including <br>
<ul>
  <li> Where has obesity been increasing or decreasing? <br>
  <li> Which states experience the highest obesity rates and highest rate of increase in the last decade? <br>
  <li> What socio-economic factors are correlated with higher obesity rates? <br>
  </ul>
  
### 2. Analyzing state laws that are tied to health and wellness, including <br>
<ul>
  <li> Counts of total pieces of legislation passed by legislative topic in each state <br>
  <li> Correlations between number of laws passed by topic and overall state's obesity rate <br>
  </ul>
  
### 3. Linear Regression machine learning component. Use different socio-economic and health-related information as predictors for obesity rates on a county level in 2013. Some predictor variables include:
<ul>
  <li> Racial group <br>
  <li> Age Group <br>
  <li> Density of fast food restraunts <br>
  <li> Density of grocery stores <br>
  <li> Relative price of unhelathy consumer items like soda <br>
</ul>
  
## Motivation: Are food deserts to blame for rising obesity rates?
##### Obesity is a complex health issue to address; it is driven by a combination of genetics and behavior. Additional contributing factors include the food and physical activity environment, education and skills, and food marketing and promotion. This project focuses on the these later areas because they are where policy makers can intervene. There is a narrative that one key drivers of the U.S. obesity epidemic is a lack of access to healthy foods in certain low income areas, and they refer to these areas as food deserts. The USDA defines a food dessert At least 500 people and/or at least 33 percent of the census tract's population residing more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store (for rural census tracts, the distance is more than 10 miles). Rural, minority, and low income areas are often the sites of food deserts because they lack large, retail food markets and have a higher number of convenience stores, where healthy foods are less available. It estimated that nearly 30 million people live in food deserts. The conclusion many draw from these statistics is that these food deserts areas have higher obesity rates poor health outcomes b/c residentes lack access to grocery stores that sell healthy food. Accordingly, they consume unhealthy foods from fast food restaurants and convenience stores as their only alternative. I wanted to test this line of thinking to see if the data told a different story.
